# Self Hosting Maybe using Docker

## Setting up docker manually

Depending on the type of infrastructure you're deploying to you might want to follow the corresponding docker install guide:

* Installing on a local machine (not recommended for production) using [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

* Installing on a remote machine using [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Deploying to one-click commercial solutions

### Linode

Follow the official linode [guide](https://www.linode.com/marketplace/apps/linode/docker/)
for installing a VPS pre-provisioned with docker.

After that is done (give it a few minutes to provision the Docker install), \
follow the steps outlined in the [self-hosting](self-hosting.md) page.
